# Syme

This project is no longer maintained; if you want to do this kind of
pairing I recommend you try [tmate](https://tmate.io) instead.

Instant collaboration on GitHub projects.

> Almost in the act of stepping on board, Gabriel Syme turned to the gaping Gregory.
>
> "You have kept your word," he said gently, with his face in shadow.
> "You are a man of honour, and I thank you. You have kept it even down
> to a small particular. There was one special thing you promised me at
> the beginning of the affair, and which you have certainly given me by
> the end of it."
> 
> "What do you mean?" cried the chaotic Gregory. "What did I promise you?"
> 
> "A very entertaining evening," said Syme, and he made a military
> salute with the sword-stick as the steamboat slid away.

## Usage

1. Enter the name of a GitHub repo.
   (Authorize Syme via GitHub if you haven't already.)
2. Enter your AWS credentials and names of GitHub users to invite.
4. SSH into the instance once it's booted using the command shown and launch `tmux`.
5. Send the login info to the users you have invited.

To invite a whole GitHub organization, simply prefix the organization
name with a `+` in the form. Syme handles launching the instance,
setting up public keys, and cloning the repository in question.

Your AWS credentials are kept in an encrypted cookie in your browser
and aren't stored server-side beyond the scope of your request.

## Setting up your own

* Create a PostgreSQL DB and export `$DATABASE_URL` to point to it.

* Create the DB schema with `lein run -m syme.db`.

### Additional steps for production

* [Register as a GitHub OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)

* Export `$OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `$OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`

If you don't set these, Syme will use an OAuth registration which is
only valid for `http://localhost:5000`.

### Additional optional steps for additional features

* Generate 16 random characters and export it as `$SESSION_SECRET`.
  Needed if you want cookies to outlast server restarts.

* Export `$CANONICAL_URL` as the fully-qualified URL of the splash page.
  Needed if you want hooks to update instance status.

* Sign up for Amazon Route53 and export `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `$AWS_SECRET_KEY`.

* Register a domain and export it as `$SUBDOMAIN` formatted like
  "%s.%s.syme.in". The `%s` places will be filled with the instance id
  and instance owner.

* Host the DNS under Route53 and export its `$ZONE_ID`.
