  <dt style="font-weight: bold">So what does Syme offer?</dt>
  <dd>It sets up disposable EC2 nodes for collaborating on GitHub
  projects via <kbd>ssh</kbd> and <kbd>tmux</kbd>.</dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<ol>
  <li>Enter the name of a GitHub repo. (Authorize Syme via GitHub if you haven't already.)</li>
  <li>Enter your AWS credentials and names of GitHub users to invite.</li>
  <li>SSH into the instance once it's booted using the command shown and launch <kbd>tmux</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Send the login info to the users you have invited.</li>
</ol>

  <dt style="font-weight: bold">How does it work?</dt>
  <dd>SSH public keys are fetched via GitHub profiles, so all
    collaborators must have a key pair with the public key uploaded to
    GitHub. You can add collaborators after the instance has launched
    with the <kbd>add-github-key</kbd> script. The Syme codebase
    is <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/syme/blob/master/src/syme/instance.clj">free
    software</a>, so you are welcome to inspect its implementation and
    contribute improvements.</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1em;">What is tmux?</dt>
  <dd>It's
    a <strong>t</strong>erminal <strong>mu</strong>ltiple<strong>x</strong>er.
    You can think of it like a window manager; it lets you keep
    multiple textual "windows" open and switch among them. But more
    importantly it allows multiple users to connect and see the same
    thing, kind of like <a href="http://www.realvnc.com/">VNC</a>
    screen sharing but dramatically faster. The first person
    runs <kbd>tmux</kbd> and others run <kbd>tmux attach</kbd> to
    join. There's a
    good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKEGA8oEWXw">introductory
    video to tmux</a> available.</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1em;">What can I run?</dt>
  <dd>You will have passwordless <kbd>sudo</kbd> on a recent Ubuntu
    VM, so anything that runs there is fair game. It limits you to
    sharing programs that run inside a terminal, so you'll need to
    brush up on your Emacs or Vim skills. It also means it's a bit
    more complicated when you need a browser. Most browsers can't run
    inside tmux, so each collaborator will have to run their own
    browser on their local machine. By default only the SSH port is
    open, so you'll either need to tunnel a connection to your HTTP
    server using <kbd>ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 syme@N.N.N.N</kbd> or
    open more ports in the "syme/$USERNAME" security group in your
    the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-west-2#s=SecurityGroups">AWS
    EC2 console</a>.</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1em;">Is it safe?</dt>
  <dd>Your AWS credentials are kept in an encrypted cookie in your
    browser and aren't stored server-side beyond the scope of your
    request. Forwarded SSH agents are disabled since otherwise
    collaborators would be able to hijack them, so Git access should
    be done over HTTPS instead. This means you'll have to enter your
    password when you push. If you don't trust Syme with your full AWS
    credentials you can provide credentials
    to <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/02/aws-identity-access-management-login-console.html">IAM
    account</a> that only has permissions to launch instances. You
    need to authorize via GitHub, but this is only to verify your
    username; GitHub does not grant access to private data to Syme.</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1em;">All this for free?</dt>
  <dd>Sort of. You will be billed by Amazon for EC2 time (m1.small)
    until the instance is halted, which you can do through Syme or
    over SSH via <kbd>sudo halt</kbd>. But Syme itself doesn't cost
    anything. You may want to periodically check
    your <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-west-2#s=Instances">AWS
    EC2 console</a> to ensure you aren't billed for instances you
    intended to stop that stayed running due to problems with Syme. In
    particular this happens due to timeout errors.</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1em;">Can it be customized?</dt>
  <dd>Sure. Adding a <kbd>.symerc</kbd> script to any GitHub
    repository will let you run project-specific setup; for instance
    installing a database server. For customizations that apply to all
    instances you launch, you can create
    a <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/.symerc"><kbd>.symerc</kbd>
    GitHub repository under your account</a> with
    a <kbd>bootstrap</kbd> script inside it. Finally, customizations
    can be applied on a per-language basis by adding shell scripts
    into <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/syme/tree/master/resources/languages">the <kbd>resources/languages</kbd>
    directory</a> of Syme's own codebase; pull requests for additional
    languages are welcome. All those scripts get run with passwordless
    sudo privileges after the repository has been checked out.</dd>
